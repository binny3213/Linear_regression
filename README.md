# linear_regression
Linear Regression implementation in Python (Mathematical concepts).

I implemented a linear regression algorithm that we studied in class as part of machine learning. For my practice code, I collected a dataset containing information on hours studied for exams and corresponding scores. By visualizing the data through a scatter plot, I gained valuable insights into the relationship between study hours and exam performance. This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my understanding of this challenging topic.
